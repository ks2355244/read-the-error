#Ruby is a dynamically typed programming language, which means that you do not have to define the type of a variable when you assign it.

#Most of the time, this is a very Good Thing. Rubyists can use duck typing, which is a form of dynamic typing.

#In duck typing, one is concerned with just those aspects of an object that are used, rather than with the type of the object itself.

#Sometimes, though, the objects our program receives are of a different type than the ones we expected it to receive. This is called a TypeError, and you will see them all over the place in Ruby programs. So get used to it.

#The goal of the code below is to produce an output string and a sorted array from an array input. There is at least one error in this code. You must find it. You must fix it.


def print_and_sort(array)
  output_string = " "
  array.each do |element|
    output_string = output_string + " " + element
  end
  puts output_string
  array.sort
end

words = %w{ all i can say is that my life is pretty plain }
words_with_nil = words.dup.insert(3, nil)
mixed_array = ["2", 1, "5", 4, "3"]

print_and_sort(words)
print_and_sort(words_with_nil)
print_and_sort(mixed_array)
